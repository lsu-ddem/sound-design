### Absences

From PS-22:
Class attendance is the responsibility of the student. The student is expected to attend all classes. A student who finds it necessary to miss class assumes responsibility for making up examinations, obtaining lecture notes, and otherwise compensating for what may have been missed. The course instructor will determine the validity of a student's reason(s) for absences and will assist those students who have valid reasons.  
Valid reasons for absences include:

1.  Illness
2.  Serious family emergency
3.  Special curricular requirements such as judging trips or field trips
4.  Court-imposed legal obligations such as subpoenas or jury duty
5.  Military obligations
6.  Serious weather conditions
7.  Religious observances
8.  Participation in varsity athletic competitions or university musical events

The student is responsible for providing reasonable advance notification and appropriate documentation of the reason for the absence. Should the instructor and student disagree over the validity of a reason for an absence, the student has the right to appeal the instructor's decision according to the general appeal procedure in PS-48.
